# Options_Calculator_with_Binomial_model
Binomial model is arguably the simplest techniques used for option pricing. In this calculator, the options price will be calculated by two binomial-tree methods,Cox-Ross-Rubinstein and Jarrow-Rudd (the equal-probability model).   Each of the approaches has its advantages and disadvantages for pricing different types of options. However, they all involve a similar tree-step process.  * There are only two possible prices for the underlying asset on the next day. * The two possible prices are the up-price and down-price * No dividends are paid out during the optionâ€™s life. * The risk-free rate is constant throughout the life of the option * There are no transaction and commissions costs in buying the option. * Investors are risk neutral
